2. Enter a name for your sniper strategy
3. Input the token address you want to target
4. Select token type (SOL or wSOL)
5. Enter the buy amount 
6. Set your target profit percentage and stop-loss values
7. Configure slippage tolerance
8. Enable/disable auto-approve transactions
9. Save your configuration

### 3. Start Sniping

2. Click the "Start Snipe" button to activate your sniper
3. The bot will monitor the selected token and execute the purchase as soon as it's available
4. Once executed, you'll be redirected to the transactions page

### 4. Monitor Results

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

### Slippage Settings

Adjust slippage tolerance based on market conditions:
- **Low (0.5-1%)**: For stable tokens with high liquidity
- **Medium (1-3%)**: General recommendation for most tokens
- **High (3-5%+)**: For highly volatile new listings with low liquidity

### Auto Take-Profit / Stop-Loss

Configure your risk management strategy:
- **Take-Profit**: Set a target percentage (e.g., 100%, 200%) to automatically sell and secure profits
- **Stop-Loss**: Set a limit (e.g., 30%) to exit positions if the market moves against you

### Token Type Selection

Choose between SOL and wSOL based on your strategy:
- **SOL**: Native Solana token, lower fees but requires additional swap when purchasing certain tokens
- **wSOL**: Wrapped SOL token, directly compatible with more DEXes but may have higher transaction overhead

## ⚠️ Security Notes

- **Risk Management**: Only use funds you are willing to risk. The volatile nature of new token launches involves significant risk.
- **Due Diligence**: Always research tokens before sniping. This tool provides the technology, but the investment decision is yours.
- **Test Mode**: Consider testing with smaller amounts before committing large capital.
